        <h4 class="av-pg3-h4">In-Ceiling/In-Wall Speakers</h4>
        <p class="av-pg3-p">In-ceiling or in-wall speakers are the most common type of speaker found in homes due to the fact that it has a clean look. Most in-wall speakers
          are designed to provide good quality sound while keeping a low profile. A larger bookshelf speaker sitting on a stand is going to provide a
          better quality sound but it is going to look ugly, especially if its mounted to an on-wall stand/bracket. In-wall speakers are the solution to this issue.
          In-wall speakers have come a long way over the years, good in-walls can create an incredible surround sound home theater experiance.</p>

        <p class="av-pg3-p">Something to remember about in-wall
          speakers is that it does take a good amount of installation and set up. Speaker wire must be run to each speaker through the wall and be connected back to an amp or a receiver of some kind.</p>

        <h4 class="av-pg3-h4">Bookshelf Speakers</h4>

        <p class="av-pg3-p">
          Bookshelf speakers come in many different styles and colors depending on the manufacturer.
          Bookshelf and freestanding speakers are the best sounding speakers and preferred by audio experts. Bookshelf speakers have a substancial cabinet enclosure which improves the sound quality. Bookshelf/freestanding speakers do require space
          but especially nice looking speakers that are on display in a room can be considered pieces of art.
        </p>

        <h4 class="av-pg3-h4">Wireless Speakers</h4>
        <p class="av-pg3-p">
          Everyone wants to know if they can get speakers that don't require any kind of wiring. The answer is most cases is no! However, within the last decade wireless speakers have become something that is possible for certain applications. Sonos
          is a company that makes great wireless speakers that communicate through the home network/internet.
          Sonos makes a series of standalone speakers as well as an amp and preamp. Sonos is completely controlled through a mobile app or computer and integrates with most music streaming services. Something like Sonos is a great solution for
          someone who is looking for true wireless house audio.
        </p>

        <p class="av-pg3-p">
          The speakers themselves only require power and an internet connection. The stand alone speakers sound pretty good however people who really know good speakers will tell you that they are not as good as the traditional wired speaker/amp set up.
        </p>

        <h4 class="av-pg3-h4">Outdoor Speakers</h4>
        <p class="av-pg3-p">
          There are so many different outdoor speakers and configurations.  All outdoor speakers whether they are on-walls, satellites, or rock speakers, are specially designed to be all weather/outdoor proof.  These speakers will need to be wired together
          still going back to an outdoor amplifier of some kind.  The amount of speakers that can be utilized depends on the location and the amplifier.  Special outdoor subwoofers are usually part of a set of speakers that are designed to work together.
          Just like anywhere else, having an outdoor sub makes a huge difference in the end user's sound experiance.
        </p>
        <h4 class="av-pg3-h4">High End/High Resolution Speakers</h4>
        <p class="av-pg3-p">
        High end freestanding speakers are carefully designed and look like spaceships.  Brands such as Bowers & Wilkins, Monitor Audio, and Moon Audio among countless others are committed to making "the Ferrari of speakers."
        Having the speakers is just half the battle, whereas suitable cabling as well power amplifiers are needed to complete the set up.  It is also reccomended to add a high end powered subwoofer into the system especially you want to feel the bass
        when music is playing.  There is so much more to know about higher end speakers and systems that is not covered in this guide.
